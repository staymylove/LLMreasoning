The probability of the spinner landing on A is 1/3 and the probability of the spinner landing on B is 5/12. What is the probability of the spinner landing on C? Express the answer as a common fraction.\n\n**Understanding the Problem:**\n- The spinner has three parts: A, B, and C.\n- The probability of landing on A is 1/3.\n- The probability of landing on B is 5/12.\n- We need to find the probability of landing on C.\n\n**Possible Approach:**\n1. **Use the Law of Total Probability:**\n   - Since the spinner must land on one of the three parts, the sum of the probabilities of landing on A, B, and C must equal 1.\n   - We can use the equation: P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1 to solve for P(C).\n\n2. **Calculate P(C) Directly:**\n   - Alternatively, if we can find the probability of landing on C directly, we can skip the Law of Total Probability.\n\n**Step 1: Use the Law of Total Probability.**\n\nFirst, let's recall the Law of Total Probability:\n\\[ P(A \\text{ or } B \\text{ or } C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) \\]\nSince the spinner must land on one of these parts, the total probability is 1.\n\\[ P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1 \\]\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{3} \\)\n- \\( P(B) = \\frac{5}{12} \\)\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{5}{12} + P(C) = 1 \\]\n\n**Find a Common Denominator:**\nTo add the fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 12.\n\\[ \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{5}{12} + P(C) = 1 \\]\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\\[ \\frac{4 + 5}{12} + P(C) = 1 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{9}{12} + P(C) = 1 \\]\n\n**Solve for P(C):**\n\nSubtract 9/12 from both sides:\n\\[ P(C) = 1 - \\frac{9}{12} \\]\n\nTo subtract fractions, find a common denominator, which is 12:\n\\[ P(C) = \\frac{12}{12} - \\frac{9}{12} \\]\n\nSubtract:\n\\[ P(C) = \\frac{12 - 9}{12} \\]\n\\[ P(C) = \\frac{3}{12} \\]\n\n**Simplify P(C):**\n\nThe fraction 3/12 can be simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3.\n\\[ P(C) = \\frac{3 รท 3}{12 รท 3} \\]\n\\[ P(C) = \\frac{1}{4} \\]\n\n**Verification:**\n\nTo ensure our solution is correct, we can plug the value of P(C) back into the original equation to see if it holds true:\n\\[ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{5}{12} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1 \\]\n\nFind a common denominator, which is 12:\n\\[ \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{5}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = 1 \\]\n\nAdd the fractions:\n\\[ \\frac{4 + 5 + 3}{12} = 1 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{12}{12} = 1 \\]\n\nThis confirms that our solution for P(C) is correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe probability of the spinner landing on C is 1/4.\n</Thought>\n\n<Output>\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\n</Output> +",

We're given the probability of landing on A as 1/3 and the probability of landing on B as 5/12. We need to find the probability of landing on C.\n\nTo start, let's recall the fundamental rule that the sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes must equal 1. In this case, the spinner has three parts, so the sum of their probabilities should be 1.\n\nLet P(A) be the probability of landing on A, P(B) be the probability of landing on B, and P(C) be the probability of landing on C. We already know P(A) = 1/3 and P(B) = 5/12.\n\nFirst, let's ensure that P(B) can be converted to a common denominator with P(A) to facilitate the calculation. The least common multiple (LCM) of 3 and 12 is 12. So, we can convert P(A) to have a denominator of 12:\n\nP(A) = 1/3 = 4/12\n\nNow, P(A) and P(B) both have a denominator of 12:\n\nP(A) = 4/12\nP(B) = 5/12\n\nThe sum of these probabilities should equal 1:\n\nP(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1\n\nSubstituting the known probabilities:\n\n4/12 + 5/12 + P(C) = 1\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n9/12 + P(C) = 1\n\nTo isolate P(C), subtract 9/12 from both sides:\n\nP(C) = 1 - 9/12\n\nTo perform the subtraction, find a common denominator, which is 12:\n\nP(C) = 12/12 - 9/12\n\nNow, subtract the fractions:\n\nP(C) = 3/12\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nP(C) = 1/4\n\nTherefore, the probability of the spinner landing on C is 1/4.\n</Thought>\n\n<Output>\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}\n</Output> +",

This is because one of the outcomes must happen, and the probabilities are normalized to represent the likelihood of each outcome.\n\nI'm given that the probability of landing on A is 1/3 and the probability of landing on B is 5/12. To find the probability of landing on C, I need to determine the remaining probability after accounting for A and B.\n\nTo start, I'll add the probabilities of A and B to see if it adds up to 1.\n\n1/3 + 5/12 = ?\n\nTo add fractions with different denominators, I'll find the least common denominator (LCD), which in this case is 12.
