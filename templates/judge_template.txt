I will show you a [Math Problem] and a [Partial Solution] with multiple steps where all steps except possibly the last one are known to be correct. Your task is to determine if the **last step** in the [Partial Solution] is mathematically valid and follows logically from the previous steps.

--------------------------------------------------

[Math Problem]

{problem}

[Partial Solution]

{response}

--------------------------------------------------

Please evaluate whether the **last step** in the [Partial Solution] is correct, based on:
1. Mathematical validity
2. Logical consistency with previous steps
3. Proper application of mathematical rules and operations

Note:
1. All steps before the last step in the [Partial Solution] are guaranteed to be correct
2. You only need to verify if the last step follows logically from the previous steps
3. Focus on whether the mathematical reasoning in the last step is valid

Reply with only '+' for valid or '-' for invalid in the end of your response.
